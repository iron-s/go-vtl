\A

#set($woo = "bar")

$woo => bar

The following should print 'as is' : 
\a
"\r"

Now, test the built in directives. Note that foo if null:
#set($foo = $foo + 1)
#if($foo)
#if ( $foo )
#else
#end
#elseif(

Set it to some value:
$foo -> 1
#if(1)
#if($foo)

The following two are references :
	$provider.Title = lunatic
	$provider.getTitle() = lunatic

Now, pluggable directives:

#notadirective
#foreach
